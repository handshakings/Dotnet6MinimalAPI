# Minimal Web API (Best for Microservices & Azure Functions)
Minimal API is a new template that uses all the C# 10 features and .NET 6 to create simple services with less complexity, layers, classes or using the traditional MVC template with controllers. This is inspired by other technologies like node.js, python, and go. This is a good template to create microservices and Azure functions.
